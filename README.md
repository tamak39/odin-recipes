Repo for the first project in The Odin Project - Recipes

This is the first project assignment in TOP, by the end of it I'll have
made a simple index.html as a main page for a recipe site, which links
to a few recipes, each having it's own page to live on.

The first iteration of this site mainly focuses on practicing html and
site folder structure. Later on it will be revisited to add css to it.
